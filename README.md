### Design Choices
Design choices forn this project are focused around two font familys and a current color scheme. However as mentioned in the primary project goals, these themes are theoretically subject to change. Current design choices are as follows: 

- Font family 1: Raleway - Raleway was chosen because of its sleek and proffesional strcutre, proving a minimilaist desing reflecting clarity of the websites goals

- Font family 2: Neon - Neon was chosen because it subtely complimented the stroke desing of raleway, clearly depicting itself as a different font whilst not being a noticeably drastic different desing choice

- Colour Choice 1: Orange (#ff7d00) - Currently  given to any non h2 body text as its acts as a complimenting hue to spotlight winner/h2 yellow theme

- Colour Choice 2: Yellow (#ffeb00) - Currently selected to relfect the colour of the Yellow Tang fish advertised as the websites spotlight winner, as per the sites advertised feature

- Background Colour Choice: Black - Currently the backgorund colour has been set to black in order to better emphasisze the brighter colours chosen for the foreground text. White or BLack shades will only be used to help increase the range of contrast visibility
